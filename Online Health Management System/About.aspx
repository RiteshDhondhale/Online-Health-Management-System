        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians, surgeons, and nurses, whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the founding religious orders or by volunteers. However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the Alexians and the Bon Secours Sisters that still focus on hospital minisrty today, as well as several other Christian denominations, including the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals. In accordance with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were originally "places lof hospitallity", and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as AIIMS, safdarjang hospital etc.
